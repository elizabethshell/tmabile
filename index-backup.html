<div id="about-main"
<br><p>I am a Cajun from Pierre Part, Louisiana – a small French settlement where everyone knows each other and many speak French, some as a first language.   I moved to Washington, DC to attend graduate school at American University with the purpose of learning about war, having missed the opportunity to cover the first Gulf War. </p> 

<br><p>In 2000, I produced and directed a film based on the book Blind Man’s Bluff by Chris Drew and Sherry Sontag.  For this two-hour film I interviewed U.S. submariners and their Russian counterparts.  Like many Americans, I grew up afraid of the Soviet Union.  The trip to Russia changed my mindset and my thinking about war.  While having lunch with my Russian translator I said that I thought that it was remarkable that we could dine “as friends after so many years of thinking of each other as enemies.”  She laughed and said “this is the difference between Americans and Russians.  We always knew that our government was lying to us and never thought of the Americans as our enemies.”</p> 
  
<br><p>In the decade and half following the horrific events of 9/11, I worked in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In Iraq, I documented as a team of US attorneys helped Iraqis build a legal case against Saddam Hussein.  I filmed at multiple mass graves as investigators dug up evidence and also spoke to victims who had been disfigured, or had relatives murdered by Saddam’s regime.  I also documented as the US efforts to install a democratic government gave way to an insurgency.</p>   

<br><p>In Afghanistan, I visited poppy farmers who were joining the ranks of the Taliban because US promises for replacement crops had failed.  For another film, years later, I documented the resurgence of the Taliban and US efforts to understand why locals were not supporting the newly elected Afghan government.</p>       

<br><p>In Pakistan, I embedded with the Pakistan military in the tribal areas, which straddle Afghanistan, on the frontlines of their war against the Taliban.  This territory is known as among the most dangerous places on earth--the dramatic yet treacherous landscapes show why it is such a hard place to fight.</p> 

<br><p>In 2014, I produced and directed a film for National Geographic, American War Generals.  The film tells the stories of the top generals who led America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They had joined the Army as America’s war in Vietnam was winding down and they had vowed never to make the mistakes their generals had made in Vietnam.  Nonetheless, these generals found themselves and their Army bogged down again in Vietnam-like insurgencies in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>    

<br><p>In 2016, with director Greg Barker, I produced a documentary for CNN FILMS about the U.S. Special Forces who were the first on the ground in Afghanistan after 9/11. The film is about the successful campaign that overthrew the Taliban, but also about the personal journeys of these Special Forces soldiers who have been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for the past decade and half.  The film will premiere in 2017.</p>
