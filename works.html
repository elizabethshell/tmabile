					<p>To premiere in 2017 theatrically and on CNN.  The film is about the Special Forces who were the first on the ground in Afghanistan after 9/11.  Known as America’s “Horse Soldiers” this gripping film tells how a small group of highly trained men toppled the Taliban in less than 90 days.  The documentary also tracks the emotional journey of these men and their families as many of them went on to fight in Iraq.</p>
